### Hola ðŸ‘‹


**mosheeshel/mosheeshel** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because it's my  profile.

I guess I like to play with new features github releases!

### My claim to fame??

The [testcontainers project](https://www.testcontainers.org/#attributions) - this awesome project, tries to help developers create better tests by making it easy for them to setup and control their external integrations (DB, files, queues, etc) from inside their test suite. Apparently (according to creators) started after encountering my little gist (see below JUnit rule gists), which I created to do just that. I'm honored! it became much bigger than I ever thought, and executed much better than I could have ever done.

Also, created Microcosm a neat PaaS that helps developers create and manage their Microservices, fast and easily, while working for Skai (AKA Kenshoo), and got to [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsNxTW8v_bc) at [Reversim](https://summit2017.reversim.com/session/75691af5-ce4e-2d67-ae2a-603c2f12e397.html) (my favorite conference ever who gave a lowly developer with no speaking experience a chance!) 2017  and [blog](https://medium.com/kenshoos-engineering-blog/microcosm-yes-kenshoo-has-also-built-a-paas-17b0ec4c2680) about it.
